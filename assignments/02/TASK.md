Academic literature review(s): monograph, key article(s), conference sessions
The objective is the analysis of the review of a monograph or key article (or several articles that address the same issue), a conference section in the academic field studied by the specific participant of the course.  

PARAMETERS  

Format: PowerPoint presentation.  

Number of slides: at least 10 (excluding the introductory and concluding slides).  

The content: you are asked to analyze the reviews in academic literature (or direct reviews during the selection stage, if available) in the context of their correlation with the real merits and shortcomings of the discussed monograph/article/several articles or the conference section that the course participant attended in person or studied via video (including responses from the author(s), if provided).  

Evaluation is based on a 10-point scale. The cutoff point is less than 3 out of 10 possible points. Weight of the evaluation: 25%.  

Evaluation Criteria:  

- Disclosure of the topic = degree of correlation between the reviews and the discussed text/presentations and responses of the authors - 40% of the total score; NB: on the first two slides, participants are requested to present the area of their own research, relating it to the chosen object of analysis;  

- Justification of the positions put forth by the author in response to the assignment - 40% of the total score;  

- Visual representativeness of the project - 10% of the total score;  

- Spelling, punctuation, and style - 10% of the total score.  

Important! In cases of academic misconduct by the student (focusing on plagiarism and data falsification), the score may be nullified.  

An additional advantage will be the use of research context in the argumentation (comparisons with other studies conducted in this field during the same time frame as the publication of the monograph/articles—5 to 7 years in either direction)—up to a 30% increase in the score.  

When rounding up to a specified decimal place, the next significant digit to the right of the targeted digit will be considered. If this digit is 5 or greater, the rounding up will be upwards.  

Number of authors on the project: Completion of the assignment is permitted by up to 4 authors. In this case, it is necessary to include a slide at the end of the presentation that indicates the significance of each author's contribution.  

Note 1: If it is not possible to find discussions in video, audio, or written representation, this part of the analysis may be omitted; it is acceptable to study the case by referencing or using ideas from other authors.  

Note 2: In the case of analyzing reviews of texts presented in other languages, the assignment must invariably be presented in English.  

Note 3: Reviews can be found on publishing house websites, journal pages, as well as through conversations with colleagues, and also based on personal participation in projects.  

Note 4: If reviews are absent in the public domain, please focus on tracing the reception of the author's ideas in other publications and sources. Consequently, the criterion for the significance of the discussed text is the presence of an acceptable level of citation within the relevant field of study, which has already been partially mentioned.  

NB: to be completed by the deadline (see further). An extension may be granted upon submission of an official medical certificate regarding illness or by providing a similar document regarding participation in a project that significantly contributes to the MIPT brand, of which I should be informed no later than one week.  

Please account for the possibility of connectivity issues when uploading responses to the LMS, and it is advisable to upload the file at least 10 minutes before the deadline. 

Good luck to all of you again!
