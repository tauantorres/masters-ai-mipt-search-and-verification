    "Academic literature review(s): monograph, key article(s), conference sessions\n",
    "The objective is the analysis of the review of a monograph or key article (or several articles that address the same issue), a conference section in the academic field studied by the specific participant of the course.  \n",
    "\n",
    "PARAMETERS  \n",
    "\n",
    "Format: PowerPoint presentation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Number of slides: at least 10 (excluding the introductory and concluding slides).  \n",
    "\n",
    "The content: you are asked to analyze the reviews in academic literature (or direct reviews during the selection stage, if available) in the context of their correlation with the real merits and shortcomings of the discussed monograph/article/several articles or the conference section that the course participant attended in person or studied via video (including responses from the author(s), if provided).  \n",

    "\n",
    "Evaluation Criteria:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Disclosure of the topic = degree of correlation between the reviews and the discussed text/presentations and responses of the authors - 40% of the total score; NB: on the first two slides, participants are requested to present the area of their own research, relating it to the chosen object of analysis;  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Justification of the positions put forth by the author in response to the assignment - 40% of the total score;  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Visual representativeness of the project - 10% of the total score;  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Spelling, punctuation, and style - 10% of the total score.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Important! In cases of academic misconduct by the student (focusing on plagiarism and data falsification), the score may be nullified.  \n",
    "\n",
    "An additional advantage will be the use of research context in the argumentation (comparisons with other studies conducted in this field during the same time frame as the publication of the monograph/articles—5 to 7 years in either direction)—up to a 30% increase in the score.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When rounding up to a specified decimal place, the next significant digit to the right of the targeted digit will be considered. If this digit is 5 or greater, the rounding up will be upwards.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Number of authors on the project: Completion of the assignment is permitted by up to 4 authors. In this case, it is necessary to include a slide at the end of the presentation that indicates the significance of each author's contribution.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Note 1: If it is not possible to find discussions in video, audio, or written representation, this part of the analysis may be omitted; it is acceptable to study the case by referencing or using ideas from other authors.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Note 2: In the case of analyzing reviews of texts presented in other languages, the assignment must invariably be presented in English.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Note 3: Reviews can be found on publishing house websites, journal pages, as well as through conversations with colleagues, and also based on personal participation in projects.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Note 4: If reviews are absent in the public domain, please focus on tracing the reception of the author's ideas in other publications and sources. Consequently, the criterion for the significance of the discussed text is the presence of an acceptable level of citation within the relevant field of study, which has already been partially mentioned.  \n",
    "\n",
    "NB: to be completed by the deadline (see further). An extension may be granted upon submission of an official medical certificate regarding illness or by providing a similar document regarding participation in a project that significantly contributes to the MIPT brand, of which I should be informed no later than one week.  \n",

    "\n",
    "**Slide 05**\n",
    "**Title:** Critical Reception & Oversights\n",
    "**Content:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The article by Machine Learning for Fluid Mechanics (Brunton, Noack & Koumoutsakos, 2020) acknowledges its own limitations: e.g., “ML algorithms often come without guarantees for performance, robustness, or convergence” and “Incorporating and enforcing known flow physics is a challenge and opportunity for ML algorithms”. ([Scribd][1])\n",
    "* A subsequent review/perspective: Machine learning in fluid dynamics: A critical assessment (Taira, Rigas & Fukami, 2025) emphasises that although ML has out-performed traditional approaches in some cases, “many fluid mechanics problems remain beyond the reach of current machine-learning techniques.” ([link.aps.org][2])\n",
    "* The 2025 piece further highlights key challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Need for **community-maintained datasets** and **open-source code repositories** to accelerate progress. ([arXiv][3])\n",
    "  * The gap between excitement and the reality of applying ML in complex fluid-flow problems (e.g., high Reynolds-number turbulence, multiphase flows) remains significant.\n",
    "* **Critical point for your analysis:** Although Brunton et al. set out a forward-looking agenda, actual uptake and mature validation of many of their “emerging opportunities” remain partial. Use this gap as part of your evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Slide 06**\n",
    "**Title:** Specific Critical Points & Their Implications\n",
    "**Content:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Generalizability & interpretability**: ML methods in fluid mechanics are often “black-boxes”. Although Brunton et al. address interpretability (“When do methods succeed or fail?”) ([Scribd][1]), later assessments argue that interpretability remains a major barrier.\n",
    "* **Physics-integration challenges**: Brunton et al. call for hybrid models (data + first-principles) but leave many open-ended questions about how this will scale. The 2025 critique emphasises that the field is still in “critical transitional state”. ([link.aps.org][2])\n",
    "* **Reproducibility, dataset bias, industrial relevance**: The 2025 article calls out that many ML applications in fluids rely on curated, idealised datasets rather than “real-world” complex flows, and that open sharing remains limited.\n",
    "* **Implication for your research area**: For your interest in porous media & continuum mechanics + ML, these critiques matter: does Brunton et al.’s framework readily apply to highly non-linear porous media flows and deformation coupling (your background)? Probably not fully yet — you can highlight this gap.\n",
    "* **Suggested bullet for slide:** “The review’s ambition is broad; the follow-up literature shows that several of its identified ‘opportunities’ remain aspirational rather than fully realised.”\n",

    "**Title:** Major Praises & Strengths\n",
    "**Content:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Brunton et al.’s article has become a **widely-cited reference** in ML + fluid mechanics: Google Scholar cites show thousands of citations. ([scholar.google.com][4])\n",
    "* It is praised for **bringing clarity** to a rapidly evolving field: its lucid breakdown of ML methods (SVM, Random Forest, Neural Networks etc) and connection to fluid-mechanics tasks (reduced-order modelling, control) has been widely used. ([arXiv][5])\n",
    "* The article is appreciated for **setting an agenda**: the section “Future Issues” (e.g., interpretability, hybridization, open-science) has guided many subsequent research directions. ([Scribd][1])\n",
    "* From the 2023 survey A Review of Physics‑Informed Machine Learning in Fluid Mechanics (Sharma et al., 2023): It references Brunton et al. as foundational in the PIML (physics-informed ML) subfield, indicating the review’s influence. ([MDPI][6])\n",

    "**Title:** Why It Works: Key Merits Linked to Your Context\n",
    "**Content:**\n",

    "* **Broad applicability**: The article covers modelling, control, optimisation — this breadth means it maps well onto many problems (including your porous-media + ML interest).\n",
    "* **Bridging communities**: The authors explicitly appeal to both fluid-mechanics researchers and ML/data scientists, helping foster interdisciplinary work — which fits your integration of continuum mechanics + AI.\n",
    "* **Visionary timing**: Published in 2020 (based on 2019 advance version) just before the major generative-AI boom, the article was ahead of the curve; your Slide 03 already highlights this.\n",
    "* **Framework for future work**: The “strengths & limitations” section, plus the “future issues”, mean the article is not just descriptive but normative — telling the field where to go. This makes it strong for your assignment because you can assess how those prescriptions have played out in 2023–25.\n",

    "**Title:** Critical Reception & Oversights\n",
    "**Content:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The article by Machine Learning for Fluid Mechanics (Brunton, Noack & Koumoutsakos, 2020) acknowledges its own limitations: e.g., “ML algorithms often come without guarantees for performance, robustness, or convergence” and “Incorporating and enforcing known flow physics is a challenge and opportunity for ML algorithms”. ([Scribd][1])\n",
    "* A subsequent review/perspective: Machine learning in fluid dynamics: A critical assessment (Taira, Rigas & Fukami, 2025) emphasises that although ML has out-performed traditional approaches in some cases, “many fluid mechanics problems remain beyond the reach of current machine-learning techniques.” ([link.aps.org][2])\n",
    "* The 2025 piece further highlights key challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Need for **community-maintained datasets** and **open-source code repositories** to accelerate progress. ([arXiv][3])\n",
    "  * The gap between excitement and the reality of applying ML in complex fluid-flow problems (e.g., high Reynolds-number turbulence, multiphase flows) remains significant.\n",
    "* **Critical point for your analysis:** Although Brunton et al. set out a forward-looking agenda, actual uptake and mature validation of many of their “emerging opportunities” remain partial. Use this gap as part of your evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Slide 06**\n",
    "**Title:** Specific Critical Points & Their Implications\n",
    "**Content:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Generalizability & interpretability**: ML methods in fluid mechanics are often “black-boxes”. Although Brunton et al. address interpretability (“When do methods succeed or fail?”) ([Scribd][1]), later assessments argue that interpretability remains a major barrier.\n",
    "* **Physics-integration challenges**: Brunton et al. call for hybrid models (data + first-principles) but leave many open-ended questions about how this will scale. The 2025 critique emphasises that the field is still in “critical transitional state”. ([link.aps.org][2])\n",
    "* **Reproducibility, dataset bias, industrial relevance**: The 2025 article calls out that many ML applications in fluids rely on curated, idealised datasets rather than “real-world” complex flows, and that open sharing remains limited.\n",
    "* **Implication for your research area**: For your interest in porous media & continuum mechanics + ML, these critiques matter: does Brunton et al.’s framework readily apply to highly non-linear porous media flows and deformation coupling (your background)? Probably not fully yet — you can highlight this gap.\n",
    "* **Suggested bullet for slide:** “The review’s ambition is broad; the follow-up literature shows that several of its identified ‘opportunities’ remain aspirational rather than fully realised.”\n"

    "During my Bachelor's degree, I focused in study Continuum Mechanics, \n",
