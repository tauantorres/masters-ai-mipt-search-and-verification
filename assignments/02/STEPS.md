Perfect — this is a **literature review analysis project**, and you’re being asked to:

> ✅ choose a **monograph, key article(s), or conference session**,<br>
> ✅ **analyze how it was reviewed** (by other scholars or participants),<br>
> ✅ **connect it to your own research area**,<br>
> ✅ and **critically assess** whether those reviews match the real merits or flaws of the work.<br>

Let’s break down how to start this **step-by-step** 👇

---

## 🧭 Step 1 — Choose your topic and object of analysis

You need to pick **one** of these:

* 📘 **A monograph** (a single-author academic book or detailed study on one topic),
* 📄 **A key article or group of related articles** on the same issue,
* 🎤 **A conference session** (either one you attended or a recorded one you can access online).

➡️ The choice should **relate to your own research field**.


---

## 🧩 Step 2 — Find the academic **reviews or reception**

Once you pick the work, your goal is to **analyze its academic reception** — i.e. how scholars discussed or reviewed it.

You can find these:

* In **Google Scholar** → search `"review of [book title]"` or look at **cited by** references.
* On the **publisher’s website** (e.g. MIT Press, Cambridge University Press).
* In **academic journals** like *AI & Society*, *Journal of AI Research*, *Ethics and Information Technology*, etc.
* In **conference proceedings**, or even YouTube if you pick a conference talk.

If there are **no explicit reviews**, you can analyze **how the author’s ideas were cited or received** in later publications.

## 📊 Step 3 — Plan your PowerPoint (structure)

Here’s a simple structure that matches the grading criteria:

| Slide | Content                                 | Notes                                                           |
| ----- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | **Title + Authors**                     | Project title, your name, course name                           |
| 2     | **Your Research Area**                  | Briefly explain your field and link it to the chosen work       |
| 3     | **Object of Analysis**                  | Describe the monograph/article/session and its main thesis      |
| 4     | **Reviews Overview**                    | Where the reviews came from, who wrote them                     |
| 5–6   | **Positive Reviews (Main Merits)**      | Summarize and quote key praise points                           |
| 7–8   | **Critical Reviews (Shortcomings)**     | Summarize critiques or controversial points                     |
| 9     | **Your Critical Evaluation**            | Your judgment: Do you agree with the reviewers? Were they fair? |
| 10    | **Comparative Context**                 | Mention other similar studies (±5–7 years around publication)   |
| 11    | **Conclusions**                         | What this tells us about the topic and its relevance            |
| 12    | **References / Sources**                | Full bibliographic list                                         |
| +1    | *(If team project)* Contributions slide |                                                                 |

## 🧠 Step 4 — Analytical focus (what the professor wants)

You must analyze **the correlation between reviews and the actual content**.
That means:

* Did reviewers understand the author correctly?
* Were their criticisms justified or biased?
* Did the author (if they responded) address them convincingly?
* Does your own analysis align with or contradict those reviews?

---

## 🎨 Step 5 — Visuals & formatting

* Use **figures, quotes, and timeline graphics** (conference sessions, citation trends).
* Avoid text-heavy slides — keep bullets short.
* Include **citations** on slides (APA or MLA).

---

## ✳️ Step 6 — Bonus points (up to +30%)

To gain the “up to +30% increase”:

* Compare your chosen work with **2–3 other publications from 5–7 years before/after**.

  * Example: if reviewing a 2018 article, include works from 2011–2025.
  * Show how the discussion evolved or how your chosen work influenced later research.

## 🧩 Step 7 — What to do next

Let’s begin by deciding **what you’ll analyze**.
Please tell me:

1. Your specific **field of research** (e.g. AI ethics, AI in law, political economy of AI, etc.), and
2. Whether you prefer to review a **book**, an **academic article**, or a **conference session**.

Once you tell me that, I’ll:

* suggest 2–3 concrete, high-quality works,
* show where to find their reviews, and
* give you a ready-to-use **PowerPoint outline** with slide-by-slide draft text.

Would you like me to start by suggesting the works next?
